# Introduction

# This guide shows some of the more common and/or easy ways to make maps in
# R using map-tile-based backgrounds with data plotted over the base maps.
# We introduce *coordinate reference systems*, *recommended packages* which
# allow tile-based map drawing, a few ways of *including user data*, and an
# Appendix on simple *coordinate conversion*.

#   The intention is to provide options to plot informative maps, which include the
# type of data collected in this class, relatively simply. We *will not* cover
# vector-based maps, importing GIS shapefiles, interpolation of point data,
# chloropleth maps, and many other map plotting methods.


### load packages needed to make maps ####

# ...also read some *data* we need for map annotations, make some *colour*
#   *palettes* to use later, and set any alternative Windows *fonts*:

if(!require(sf)) install.packages("sf")            
if(!require(maptiles)) install.packages("maptiles")     
if(!require(prettymapr)) install.packages("prettymapr") 
if(!require(viridis)) install.packages("viridis") 
if(!require(scico)) install.packages("scico")  # OPTIONAL
if(!require(ggmap)) install.packages("ggmap") 

library(sf)            # Simple Features spatial data in R
library(maptiles)      # get open-source map tiles for background maps
library(prettymapr)    # add scale bar and north arrows to maps
library(viridis)       # colourblind-friendly colour palettes
library(scico)         # more colourblind-friendly colour palettes # OPTIONAL
library(ggmap)         # plotting spatial data with ggplot syntax

# load maps data and do setups
git <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ratey-AtUWA/"
afr_map <- read.csv(file=paste0(git,"spatial/main/afr_map_v2.csv"), 
                    stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
places <- read.csv(file=paste0(git,"Learn-R/main/places.csv"),
                   stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
pal4lite <- c("black", viridis::plasma(8), "white")
pal4liteTransp <- c("black", 
                    scico::scico(8, alpha = 0.7, palette = "hawaii", beg=0.1),
                    "white")
pal4dark <- c("white", viridis::turbo(8, beg=0.2, end=0.9,dir=1), "black")

## Preparing to make maps ####

# First we read the data we need: from `.csv` files on a website, into an R
#   data frame:

# afs19 <- read.table('clipboard', header=T, sep="\t", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
# alternative code reading data from a file:
afs19 <- read.csv(file=paste0(git,"Learn-R/main/afs19.csv"), 
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE) # use this one
afs22 <- read.csv(file=paste0(git,"Learn-R/main/afs22S1.csv"), 
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# -=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-
## **Notes about maps** #####

# [distilled from the author instructions of a few relevant journals] 

# Include a **scale**, and **north arrow** (and where relevant, **co-ordinates**
# of latitude (째N, 째S) and longitude (째W, 째E); grid-based systems such as UTM
# are also ok, and can allow scale to be omitted if grid measurements are in
# metres).

# The use of colour unnecessarily is discouraged. 

# - All text must be large enough to be readable. Avoid making the lettering 
# too large for the figure - this can result in a "cartoonish" appearance. 

# - Use a clear, sans serif typeface - the R default is Arial (Helvetica, 
# Segoe UI, Source Sans Pro, Ubuntu, etc. are all OK).  

# Try to keep all text in a figure (including axis labels, contour labels,
# latitude and longitude, scale text, inset text, *etc.*) around the same size
# to aid reducibility and/or enlargement.

# Use a white background behind lettering that crosses a dark or textured area
# in a figure.

# Maps must show locations of any significant places/sample points, etc.,
# mentioned in your report's text or tables. These might include cities, rivers,
# lakes, ponds, drains, landmarks, presumed sources of contamination, and so on.
# (These features are not always present on map tiles.)

# A country map is required for all studies, locating the study area. Adjacent
# countries must be located and named. [*Optional for this class*].


# Before we start downloading map data, we define and save some commonly-used
# coordinate reference systems which describe the map projection of our GPS
# data. The function `st_crs()` is from the `sf` package (see explanation
# below), and as the argument for the `st_crs()` function we use the EPSG code
# for the desired projection. See https://epsg.io for more information.
# -=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-=+=-


### define CRS (coordinate reference system)
LongLat <- st_crs(4326) # uses Earth ellipsis specs from WGS84 datum
UTM50S <- st_crs(32750) # just for Zone 50, S hemisphere!

# We will use these coordinate reference system objects later. For now
# we're going to work in UTM coordinates.
# 
# Next we'll convert our data frames to *Simple Features* spatial data, using the 
# R package `sf` (Pebesma, 2018). Simple Features is a formal standard 
# (ISO 19125-1:2004) that describes how objects in the real world can be 
# represented in computers - see
# <https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html>.
# 
# We also make equivalents of these two sf-dataframes in the longitude-latitude
# coordinate system, using the `st_transform` function.

afs19utm <- st_as_sf(afs19[-9,], # omitting row 9 where coordinates are missing
                     coords = c("Easting","Northing"),
                     crs = UTM50S)
afs22utm <- st_as_sf(afs22, coords = c("Easting","Northing"),
                     crs = UTM50S)
afs19ll <- st_transform(afs19utm, crs = LongLat)
afs22ll <- st_transform(afs22utm, crs = LongLat)


## Alternative 1 - Maps in R using the maptiles package ####

### Defining the mapped area ####

# We define the area we need for our map and save it in a simple features object
# called `extent`.

# An easy way to get bounding coordinates (in longitude, latitude) is by using
# Google Maps or Google Earth. Google Earth allows the option to set the
# coordinate system to UTM. If we generated latitude-longitude coordinates, we
# would need to convert our *Simple Features* object (see the **Appendix**).
# If our input coordinates are Longitude-Latitude, note that south latitudes (and
# west longitudes) are negative, and we want decimal degrees rather than
# degrees-minutes-seconds. Also note that coordinates from Google Maps and Google
# Earth (except in saved `.kml` files) are in the order (Latitude, Longitude);
#i.e. (y,x), whereas (x,y) (Longitude, Latitude) seems to make more sense.

# For coordinates in the `sf` and `maptiles` packages, $x$ coordinates are
# commonly Eastings or Longitudes, and $y$ coordinates are commonly Northings or
# Latitudes.

# make map extent object, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hold'}
extent <- st_as_sf(data.frame(x=c(399800,400700),y=c(6467900,6468400)),
                   coords = c("x","y"), crs = UTM50S)

# **NOTE**: The projection we specify here will be the one the map plots in!

### Getting the map tile data ####

# We now need some functions from the `maptiles` package (Giraud 2021). We're
# using one of the OpenStreetMap tile options, but the following tile providers
# also work: 
# `OpenStreetMap, OpenStreetMap.HOT, Esri.WorldStreetMap, Esri.WorldTopoMap,
# Esri.WorldImagery, Esri.WorldGrayCanvas`, `CartoDB.Positron,
# CartoDB.DarkMatter, CartoDB.Voyager` (all CartoDB... tiles have variants which
# work), and `OpenTopoMap` 
# If you have an account with an API key, you can also use the tiles from
# https://www.thunderforest.com/ (Thunderforest 'hobby project' accounts are
# free). Sadly the Stamen tiles are no longer available.
# The option `crop = TRUE` is included to crop the tiles to our defined area in
# the `extent` object. If we leave it out, the map may change shape as it will
# use only square (uncropped) map tiles.

# The map tile style we have selected is the default `OpenStreetmap` style.

# get_tiles, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hold'}
# NOTE: projection of input object e.g. 'extent' sets map projection
aftiles <- maptiles::get_tiles(extent, provider = "OpenStreetMap", crop = TRUE)

### Plotting the map ####

# The `aftiles` object we created is a `SpatRaster` object which needs the
# `maptiles` (or `terra`) package loaded to be able to plot it - see 
# the code & output below.

par(mar=c(3.5,3.5,0.5,0.5), lend="square", font.lab=2)
plot(st_coordinates(extent), type="n", asp=1, xaxs="i", yaxs="i",
     xlab="Easting (UTM Zone 50, m)", ylab="Northing (UTM Zone 50, m)")
plot_tiles(aftiles, add=TRUE)
box()
 
# The next chunk of code adds the `prettymapr` features shown in Figure 2. In this
# code, `plotepsg = 32750` refers to the EPSG code for the UTM projection in Zone
# 50 (EPSG 32750), which we need to include so that the scale bar shows the
# correct distances. (Long-Lat is EPSG 4326 in WGS84)
# 
# **NOTE**: If the `addscalebar` function does not work, run this line of code:

source("https://github.com/Ratey-AtUWA/Learn-R/raw/main/scalebar_use_sf_prettymapr.R")

# (This will replace the function in the `prettymapr` package with a modified 
#  version that uses the `sf` package for coordinate conversions instead of `sp` and `rgdal`.)

# . . . continuing previous code . . .

# **Map annotations using maptiles - Hints**

# Plotting in the `maptiles` package using the `plot_tiles()` function (which is
# actually done by the `plotRGB()` from the `terra` package) tries to set the
# plot margins based on the dimensions of the `SpatRaster` map object. You may
# need to adjust your settings; here are some tips:

# adjust the height and width of the plot area to best match the map

# you may need to adjust the positions of the map annotations like axis titles, north arrow, and scale bar. 

# The position of the axis titles is adjusted with the `line=` option in the `mtext()` function.

# The positions of the north arrow and scale bar are adjusted with the `padin=` option in the `addnortharrow()` and `addscalebar()` functions.

### Adding our data and map annotations ####

# Very often we would like to **add our own information to a map**, such
# as the location of samples, often with different sizes, shapes, or
# colours of symbols to represent numerical information.

# Since we have a map in UTM coordinates, we can now add plots of our data based
# on UTM locations (with a legend, of course - see code & output below. We can
# plot the points from the non-spatial data frame `afs19`, but here we `plot`
# the points from `afs19utm`, with the `add=TRUE` option. We add a legend to the
# plot in the usual way.

# We can also add digitized map features such as wetland ponds, drains, etc., if

### Making a bubble map ####

# We use essentially the same code as for the maps above (except plotting the
# annotations and data in the correct order!). Then we use the `symbols()`
# function to make the 'bubbles', making sure that we include the options `add =
# TRUE` so we overplot the map, and `inches = FALSE` so we can manually scale
# the bubbles. The factor of `0.4` used to scale the circles in the code for
# bubbles and legend is *found by trial-and-error* (it *is* possible to write a
# simple algorithm to estimate a scaling factor from the data). A map like that
# shown in the output of the code below is a good exploratory data analysis
# tool, as even without the legend it shows any unevenness in concentrations,
# including where high concentrations are located.

### Categorized (e.g. percentile) bubble map ####

# We make a new column in our data frame by cutting the measurement of interest,
# in this example **Zn**, into percentiles. The new column called `QZn` is a
# factor which identifies which percentile of Zn concentration each sample is
# in. We then use this factor to define symbols, sizes, and colours for each
# sample location. We add a line break to text labels using \n.

## Alternative 2 - Maps in R using the ggmap package ####

# The `ggmap` package (Kahle and Wickham 2013) is an extension of `ggplot`, so
# it's easier to use if you are familiar with `ggplot` and the associated family
# of packages. [*You will need a Google maps API key which you can get by
# registering at https://developers.google.com/maps ]

# get-api-key
secret <- read.csv("gmapskey.csv")

# First we make a `ggmap` object, locating the map by its central coordinate
# with the extent controlled by the `zoom` option:

library(ggmap)
register_google(key = secret[1,1]) # you would replace secret[1,1] with your API key
udubua.gg <- get_googlemap(center=c(115.8213,-31.98165), 
                           zoom = 16, maptype = "roadmap", color = "bw")
rm(secret)

# This always gives a **square** map as you'll notice - which we might
# not always want. In theory, the map aspect ratio can be changed using the
# `size` argument in the `get_googlemap` function, but this does not work
# reliably. We recommend leaving the map dimensions and aspect ratio at their
# default values.

# Next we plot the ggmap object using ggplot grammar. It's possible to just plot
# the object (i.e. run `ggmap(udubua.gg)`), but it's good to have more control
# over plot options **and** to plot some data over the base map. In the example
# below, we use the aesthetic in `geom_point()` to plot
# different categories with different shapes and colours, with the categories
# defined by the factor `Type`. A range of map styles is available by selecting
# a combination of one of `maptype = "terrain", "satellite", "roadmap"`, or
# `"hybrid"`, together with `color = "color"` or `"bw"`. **Note**: the `ggsm`
# package is designed to add scale bar and north arrow to ggmaps, but it seems
# buggy and we currently don't recommend it - the north arrow seems OK though.

ggmap(udubua.gg) + 
  labs(y="Latitude (\u00B0S)", x = "Longitude (\u00B0E)") + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 115.825, y = -31.98, label = "Swan\nRiver",
                fontface = "italic", family="sans"), 
            size = 4, vjust = 0, hjust = 0, color="gray40") + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, col=Type, shape=Type), 
             data = places, size=3) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=9, color="black"),
        axis.title=element_text(size=11,face="bold"))

# There are numerous possibilities with `ggmap` and the features made possible
# by `ggplot2` that are not illustrated by our map.
# For example, we could use `size` as an aesthetic (i.e. include within
# `aes(...)` with `size = variableName`), to generate something like a bubble
# map.

### Other map types using ggmap ####

# Another option *apparently* available in `ggmap` are some of the *Stamen* map
# tiles, accessible with the `get_stamenmap()` function. **However**, the Stamen
# URLs have been updated, and this function is no longer able to download Stamen
# map tiles.

# The next example uses the simple features information in one of the data
# frames we made at the beginning. The `sf` package introduces a new 'geom',
# `geom_sf()` for plotting in `ggmap.` We need to use the option `inherit.aes =
# FALSE` in `geom_sf()`, to override the default aesthetics from the `ggmap`
# object. We also add `coord_sf` to ensure that all layers use a common CRS
# (Coordinate Reference System). 
# Run `help(geom_sf)` for more information.

# Plotting using `geom_sf()` when the CRS is in degrees adds, by default, a
# 째S/째W/째N/째E suffix to the axis values. In the code below we suppress this
# using `scale_x_continuous(label = I)` (same for the y axis; the `limits` and
# `expand` options stop the manual scale adding space around the map tiles). We
# include the information on units and hemisphere in the axis titles.

afr.gg <- get_googlemap(center=c(lon=115.9445, lat = -31.918), 
                        zoom=17, col = "bw", maptype = "terrain")
bb <- as.numeric(unlist(as.vector(attr(afr.gg, "bb"))))

                     expand = expansion(mult=c(0,0))) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(alpha = 0.7) + 
  scale_size_area(breaks = c(30,100,300,1000,3000,5000), max_size = 9) +

## Other tile-based mapping packages in R ####

# The `rosm` package (Dunnington 2022) allows users to produce background maps
# from several map tile providers. **We don't currently recommend** `rosm`,
# since it's difficult when using this package to produce axes in commonly-used
# coordinate reference systems.
# 
# The `OpenStreetMap` R package (Fellows, 2019) can make very good tile-based
# maps. Unfortunately, however, it can be difficult to use on Apple Mac
# computers, and there can also be problems with Windows-based systems due to
# the use of `Java` code in the package. So, out of respect for MacOS users, we
# are not recommending the `OpenStreetMap` package either.

## Final Words ####

# We recommend using either the `maptiles` or `ggmap` packages to draw maps with

## Appendix - coordinate conversions ####

#   **Converting UTM to LongLat**
#   
# Make a simple features (package `sf`) object containing the UTM coordinates
# 
# Example uses explicit values (as used previously to generate the `maptiles`
# map), but the coordinates could also be obtained from a data frame - edit to
# suit!

utm.temp <- st_as_sf(data.frame(x=c(399800,400700),y=c(6467900,6468400)),
                     coords = c("x","y"), crs = UTM50S)

# We then use the `st_transform()` function from the `sf` package to convert to
# long-lat (or another projection), which results in another spatial object:

longlat.temp <- st_transform(utm.temp, crs = LongLat)

# We now have two `sf` spatial objects which we can use (for instance) to
# define the map extent for a `maptiles` map:

require(sf); require(maptiles) # load packages if not done already
# using the utm object
tiles_utm <- get_tiles(utm.temp, provider = "OpenStreetMap", crop = TRUE)
# using the longitude-latitude object
tiles_longlat <- get_tiles(longlat.temp, provider = "OpenStreetMap",
                           crop = TRUE)
# . . . and so on

# To extract coordinates from a data frame, for example: <br>
#   (**NOTE** - missing coordinates are not allowed!)

afs19 <- afs19[-which(is.na(afs19[,c("Easting")])==1),] # remove rows with NAs
afs19utm <-  st_as_sf(afs19, coords = c("Easting","Northing"), crs = UTM50S)

# We then use the `st_transform()` function from the `sf` package to
# convert to longitude-latitude, which results in another spatial data frame:

afs19ll <- st_transform(afs19utm, crs = LongLat)

# To extract just the coordinate values in non-spatial form, we use the function 
# `st_coordinates()`:

# extract sf coordinates to console (can assign to object of class "matrix")
st_coordinates(afs19utm)

# extract sf coordinates to data frame
longlat.temp <- as.data.frame(st_coordinates(afs19ll))
colnames(longlat.temp) <- c("Longitude","Latitude")
