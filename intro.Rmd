This guide gets you started with reading data into **R** (R Core Team, 2022) 
from a file, including checking that the data have been read in correctly. We 
will always be using **R** in the RStudio environment (Posit Software, 2022).

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 15pt;">If you need or would like a more basic introduction to **R**, you could first read our<br>
[Guide to R and RStudio for absolute beginners](What-is-R.html){target="_blank}.</span></p>

## Reading the data

We use the `read.csv()` function &ndash; we will mostly supply data to you as 
`.csv` files. Sometimes you need to download these into your working directory 
to use them, and sometimes you can read them directly from a web URL (*e.g*. [`https://github.com/.../afs19.csv`](https://github.com/Ratey-AtUWA/learningR/raw/main/afs19.csv){target="_blank"}).

With the type of dataset we usually use, there are columns containing
categorical information, which **R** calls `factors`. These are typically stored
as text or character information, *i.e*. character strings, or just `strings`.
**R** identifies `factors` in a particular way so the categories are recognised,
so we need to use the `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` argument in the `read.csv()`
function.

The result of the `read.csv()` function is a **data frame** object stored
in the **R** environment. We need a data frame, since it is a data structure in
**R** which allows having columns of different classes (*e.g*. integer, numeric,
factor, date, logical, *etc*.) in the same object (each column contains just one 
class of data, though).

Objects we create in an **R** session like data frames are only stored while we
have our **R** session active, and disappear when we close **R**. Fortunately we
can save our whole environment by clicking the üíæ icon on the 
<span style="background-color:#404040; color:white;">&nbsp;Environment&nbsp;</span> 
tab, or by running the `save.image()` function. Either of these saving methods 
will create a file with extension `.RData` which we can then load in later **R**
sessions using the `load()` function, or clicking the üìÅ icon in the
<span style="background-color:#404040; color:white;">&nbsp;Environment&nbsp;</span> 
tab in RStudio.

```{r read-hubbard-data, results='hold'}
git <- "https://github.com/Ratey-AtUWA/Learn-R/raw/main/"
hubbard <- read.csv(file = paste0(git,"hubbard.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
# ... and do a quick check
is.data.frame(hubbard) # check that it worked; if so, the result should be TRUE
```

These data are from the [Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest](https://hubbardbrook.org/experimental-watersheds-research-sites/){target="_blank"} near Woodstock in New Hampshire, USA (Figure 1).

```{r make map extent object, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}

extent <- st_as_sf(data.frame(x=c(-127.219,-59.375),y=c(58,26)),

```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## First proper check - summarise some of the data

We can use the `summary()` function to make a quick check of our data, to make 
sure the file has read correctly (this may not happen if the file is improperly
formatted, *etc*.).

```{r}
summary(hubbard[,1:9]) # just the first 9 columns to save space!
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The `summary()` function creates a little table for each column - note that
these little tables do not all look the same. `Integer` or `numeric` columns get a
numeric summary with minimum, mean *etc.*, and sometime the number of missing
(`NA`) values. Categorical (`Factor`) columns show the number of samples (rows) in
each category (unless there are too many categories). These summaries are useful
to check if there are zero or negative values in columns, how many missing
observations there might be, and if the data have been read correctly into R.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="border: 2px solid #039; padding: 8px;">
**Note**: You would usually check the **whole data frame**, without restricting 
rows or columns, by running `summary(hubbard)`. We could also:

- summarise all variables, but only the first 10 rows by running `summary(hubbard[1:10,])` (we also call rows
'observations' which often represent separate field samples);
- summarise a defined range of both rows and columns, *e.g*. `summary(hubbard[1:20,6:10])`, which would summarise only the first 20 rows of columns 6 to 10.
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Final checks of the data frame

Usually we would not restrict the output as done below with `[,1:15]`.
We only do it here so we're not bored with pages of similar-looking output.
You should look at structure for the whole data frame using `str(hubbard)` 
(or substitute `hubbard` for whatever your data object is called). The whole 
`hubbard` data frame has 62 variables (*i.e*. columns), not 15.

```{r}
str(hubbard[,1:15]) # 'str' gives the structure of an object
```

We can see that some columns are integer (`int`) values (*e.g*. PLOT, UTM_EASTING),
some columns contain `Factor` values *i.e*. in fixed categories
(*e.g*. Rel.To.Brook, Transect), and some columns are numeric (`num`)
(*e.g*. PH, OM.pct, Ni). Applying the `str()` function to a data
object is **always** a good idea, to check that the data have read correctly
into R. [NOTE that other variable types are possible such as character
`chr`, date (`Date` or `POSIXct`), `logical`, *etc*.]

<div style="border: 2px solid #039; background-color:#ffa; padding: 8px;">
The following section describes how to make graphs and plots in **R** without 
needing any additional packages. If you would like to try making plots in the 
widely-used package `ggplot2`, then [go to this page](intro-GG.html).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

# Base R plotting: x-y plot using `plot()`

We can use either `plot(x, y, ...)` OR `plot(y ~ x, ...)` <br>
In R the `~` symbol means 'as a function of', so `~` indicates a formula.

In R we need to tell the program which 'object' our
variables are in. We've just made a Data Frame (a type
of data object) called `hubbard`.

The following 3 styles of code do exactly the same thing:

1. <u>Specifying the data frame using `with()` syntax -- (we recommend this one!)</u>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
with(hubbard,
     plot(EXCH_Al ~ PH)
)
```

...which can just be written on a single line:

```{r with-plot, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.cap="Figure 2: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH using with() to specify the data frame.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
with(hubbard, plot(EXCH_Al ~ PH))
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

2. <u>Specifying the data frame using the dollar-sign operator</u>

```{r dollar-plot, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.cap="Figure 3: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH using dollar-sign syntax to specify the data frame. Notice the axis titles!", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
plot(hubbard$EXCH_Al ~ hubbard$PH) # look at axis titles!
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

3. <u>Specifying the data frame using</u> `attach()` <u>and</u> `detach()` <u>**(not recommended)**</u>

```{r plot-attach-dummy, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
attach(hubbard)
plot(EXCH_Al ~ PH)
detach(hubbard)
```

```{r plot-attach, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.cap="Figure 4: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH using `attach()` to specify the data frame.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
attach(hubbard)
plot(EXCH_Al ~ PH)
detach(hubbard)
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Without changing any of the (numerous) options or parameters in 
the `plot()` function, the plot is not very attractive (*e.g*. axis titles!).

We can also change the overall plot appearance by using the function `par()` 
before plotting; `par()` sets graphics **par**ameters. Let's try some variations:

### Setting some overall graphics parameters using `par()`

* `mar=` sets **mar**gins in 'lines' units: `c(bottom,left,top,right)` *e.g*. `c(4,4,3,1)`
* `mgp=` sets distance of text from axes: `c(titles, tickLabels, ticks)`
* `font.lab=` sets font style for axis titles: 2=**bold**, 3=*italic*, *etc*.<br>
    - and within the `plot()` function itself, `xlab=` and `ylab=` set axis titles

```{r plot-with-options, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 5: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH improved by changing graphics parameters and including custom axis titles.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1), mgp=c(2,0.6,0), font.lab=2)
# We'll also include some better axis title text using xlab, ylab
with(hubbard,
     plot(EXCH_Al ~ PH, 
     xlab="Soil pH", 
     ylab="Exchangeable Al (centimoles/kg)")
     )
```
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This is starting to look a lot better!

We can still add more information to the graph; for example, 
by making use of the factors (categories) in the dataset. 
We also need to learn these graphics parameters:

- `col =` plotting colour(s) - it's easiest to use words like "red", "darkblue" and so on<br>
see [this R colour chart](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/xid-47078256_1){target="_blank"} <br>
or just run the R function `colors()` for a list of all 657 names!

- `pch =` plot character(s) - numbers from 0 to 24 (run `help(points)` or see <a href="https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/scatterplot-plot.html#symbol-types-pch" target="_blank">this page from YaRrr</a>).
 
```{r plot-by-groups, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 6: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH with custom graphics parameters and axis titles, improved by separating points by a Factor.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1), mgp=c(2,0.6,0), font.lab=2)
with(hubbard,
     plot(EXCH_Al ~ PH, xlab="Soil pH",
          ylab="Exchangeable Al (centimoles/kg)",
          pch=c(1,16)[Rel.To.Brook], 
          col=c("blue","darkred")[Rel.To.Brook])
     )
``` 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The parameter `pch=c(1,16)[Rel.To.Brook]` separates the points by the
information in the Factor column `Rel.To.Brook`, shown inside `[ ]`. This column
is a 2-level factor, so can be one of two categories (North or South), and so we
need a vector with two numbers in it (`pch=c(1,16)`). The code for specifying
colour is very similar, except our vector has 2 colour names in it.

There is still one thing missing; a **graph legend**. We can add one using 
the `legend()` function. We will use the following options:

- `"topleft"` position of legend -- run `help(legend)` for options, or we can use x-y coordinates
- `legend =` a vector of names identifying the plot symbols - we have used the categories in the factor 'Rel.To.Brook', `levels(hubbard$Rel.To.Brook)`, but we could have used `legend=c("North","South")` instead
- `pch =` plot symbols - should be exactly the same vector as in the plot function
- `col =` plot colours - should be exactly the same vector as in the plot function
- `title =` a title for the legend - optional

```{r plot-add-legend, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 7: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH by sample location, with custom graphics parameters and axis titles, and a legend to explain the plot symbols.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1), mgp=c(2,0.6,0), font.lab=2)
with(hubbard,
       plot(EXCH_Al ~ PH, xlab="Soil pH", 
            ylab="Exchangeable Al (centimoles/kg)",
            pch=c(1,16)[Rel.To.Brook], 
            col=c("blue","darkred")[Rel.To.Brook])
       )
legend("topleft", legend=levels(hubbard$Rel.To.Brook), pch=c(1,16), 
       col=c("blue","darkred"), title="Location")
```

<hr style="height: 3px; background-color: #5560A4;" />

# Alternative to base-R plot: `scatterplot()` (from the `car` package) 

The R package `car` (Companion to Applied Regression) has many useful 
additional functions that extend the capability of **R**. 
The next two examples produce nearly the same plot as in the previous examples, 
using the `scatterplot()` function in the `car` package.

```{r car-sp-1, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=3.5, fig.cap="Figure 8: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH made using the car::scatterplot() function.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
# load required package(s)
library(car)
# par() used to set overall plot appearance using options within 
# par(), e.g.
#     mar sets plot margins, mgp sets distance of axis title and 
#     tick labels from axis
par(font.lab=2, mar=c(4,4,1,1), mgp=c(2.2,0.7,0.0))
# draw scatterplot with customised options 
# remember pch sets plot character (symbol); 
# we will also use the parameter cex which sets symbol sizes and
# 
scatterplot(EXCH_Al ~ PH, data=hubbard, smooth=FALSE, 
            legend = c(coords="topleft"), 
            cex=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.2)
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Note that we get some additional graph features by default:

1. boxplots for each variable in the plot margins &ndash; these are useful for evaluating the distribution of our variables and any extreme values 
2. a linear regression line showing the trend of the relationship (it's possible to add this in base R plots, too) 
3. grid lines in the plot area (also available in base R)

We can turn all of these features off if we want - run `help(scatterplot)` in 
the RStudio Console, and look under **Arguments** and **Details**.

Also, we separately specify the dataset to be used as a function argument, 
*i.e*., `data=hubbard`.

### Scatterplot (`car`) with groups, Hubbard Brook soil data

```{r car-sp-2, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.cap="Figure 9: Plot of exchangeable Al vs. pH with points grouped by location, made using the car::scatterplot() function.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
# 'require()' loads package(s) if they haven't already been loaded
require(car)
# adjust overall plot appearance using options within par()
# mar sets plot margins, mgp sets distance of axis title and tick 
#   labels from axis
par(font.lab=2, mar=c(4,4,1,1), mgp=c(2.2,0.7,0.0))
# create custom palette with nice colours :)
# this lets us specify colours using numbers - try it!
palette(c("black","red3","blue3","darkgreen","sienna"))
# draw scatterplot with points grouped by a factor (Rel.To.Brook) 
scatterplot(EXCH_Al ~ PH | Rel.To.Brook, data=hubbard, smooth=FALSE,
            legend = c(coords="topleft"), col=c(5,3,1), 
            pch=c(16,0,2), cex=1.2, cex.lab=1.3, cex.axis=1.0)
```
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The `scatterplot()` function creates a legend automatically if we plot by factor 
groupings (note the different way that the legend position is specified within 
the `scatterplot()` function). This is pretty similar to the base R plot above 
(we can also customise the axis titles in `scatterplot()`, using `xlab=` and 
`ylab=` as before).

<hr style="height: 3px; background-color: #5560A4;" />

# Other types of data presentation: Plot types and Tables

We'll give you some starting code chunks, and the output from them. 
You can then use the help in RStudio to try to customise the plots according to 
the suggestions below each plot!

## Histograms

Histograms are an essential staple of statistical plots, because we always need
to know something about the distribution of our variable(s). Histograms are a
good visual way to assess the shape of a variable's distribution, whether it's
symmetrical and bell-shaped (*normal*), left- or right-skewed, bimodal (two
'peaks') or even multimodal. As with any check of a distribution, the 'shape'
will be clearer if we have more observations.

```{r basic-hist, fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, fig.cap="Figure 10: Histogram of percent soil moisture content at Hubbard Brook.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
with(hubbard, hist(MOISTURE.pct))
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

For histograms, try the following:

- add suitable axis labels (titles)
- make bars a different colour (all the same)
- change the number of cells (bars) on the histogram to give wider or narrower intervals
- log~10~-transform the x-axis (horizontal axis)
- remove the title above the graph (this information would usually go in a caption)<br>
...and so on.
 
## Box plots 

Box plots also give us some information about a variable's distribution, but one
of their great strengths is in comparing values of a variable between different
groups in our data.

*Tukey box plots* implemented by **R** have 5 key values; from least to 
greatest these are: 

1. the **lower whisker**, which is the greatest of the minimum or the *lower hinge* &minus; 1.5 &times; IQR^a^
2. the **lower hinge**, which is the lower quartile (25^th^ percentile)
3. the **median** (*i.e*. the 50^th^ percentile)
4. the **upper hinge**, which is the upper quartile (75^th^ percentile)
5. the **upper whisker**, , which is the least of the maximum or the *upper hinge* + 1.5 &times; IQR

Any points less than the lower whisker, or greater than the upper whisker, are 
plotted separately and represent **potential outliers**.

^a^**IQR** is the interquartile range between the upper and lower quartiles (25^th^ and 75^th^ percentiles)

```{r basic-boxplot-notRun, eval=FALSE}
boxplot(MOISTURE.pct ~ Rel.To.Brook, data=hubbard)
```

```{r basic-boxplot, fig.width=5.5, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Figure 11: Box plot of percent soil moisture content at Hubbard Brook. Only default `boxplot()` arguments have been used (except for the annotations explaining the boxplot features).", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hold'}
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
boxplot(MOISTURE.pct ~ Rel.To.Brook, data=hubbard, xlim=c(0.4,3.8))
bps <- with(hubbard[which(hubbard$Rel.To.Brook=="South"),], 
            boxplot.stats(MOISTURE.pct))
arrows(rep(2.7,5), bps$stats, c(2.22,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.22), bps$stats, angle=15, 
       length=0.08, col="steelblue")
text(c(rep(2.7,5),2), c(bps$stats, 19.7), pos=4, 
     labels=c("lower whisker","lower hinge","median","upper hinge",
              "upper whisker","\u2510\nsymbols\nare\npotential\noutliers\n\u2518"), 
     col="steelblue")
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

For box plots, try the following:

- include informative axis labels (titles)
- plotting boxes separated by categories in a Factor
- make boxes a different colour (all the same, and all different!)
- add notches to boxes representing approximate 95% confidence intervals around the median
- give the (vertical) y-axis a log~10~ scale<br>...and so on.
 
## Strip Charts

Strip charts, or one-dimensional scatter plots, can be a useful companion (or
alternative) to box plots, especially when we don't have many observations of a 
variable.

```{r basic-mfrow, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Figure 12: Soil organic matter content (%) at Hubbard Brook: as a one-dimensional scatterplot (`stripchart()`).", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
stripchart(hubbard$OM.pct)
```
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

For stripcharts, try the following:

- add suitable axis labels (titles), in bold font;
- make symbols a different shape &#177; colour (all the same, and all different!);
- make the strip chart vertical instead of horizontal;
- apply some 'jitter' (noise) to the symbols so that overlapping points are easier to see;
- log~10~-transform the numerical axis, so that overlapping points are easier to see;
- rotate the y-axis titles 90¬∞ clockwise (make sure the left margin is wide enough!);
- remove the titles above the graphs (this information would usually go in caption/s)<br>...and so on.

## Tables

There are a few ways to make useful tables in R to summarise your data. Here are a couple of examples.

### Using the `tapply()` function in base R

We can use the `tapply()` function to make very simple tables:

```{r tapply-tables, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
# use the cat() [conCATenate] function to make a Table heading 
#     (\n is a line break)
cat("One-way table of means\n")
with(hubbard, tapply(X = EXCH_Ni, INDEX=Transect, 
       FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE))
cat("\nTwo-way table of means\n")
with(hubbard, tapply(X = EXCH_Ni, 
       INDEX=list(Transect,Rel.To.Brook), 
       FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE))
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

For `tapply()` tables, try the following:

- we have used the `mean` function (`FUN=mean`) &ndash; try another function to get minima, maxima, standard deviations, *etc*.
- try copying the output to Word or Excel and using this to make a table in that software<br>
...and so on.

### Using the `numSummary()` function in the 'RcmdrMisc' R package

```{r numSummary tables, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hold'}
require(RcmdrMisc)
# use the cat() [conCATenate] function to make a Table heading 
#   (\n is a line break)
cat("Summary statistics for EXCH_Ni\n")
numSummary(hubbard$EXCH_Ni)
cat("\nSummary statistics for EXCH_Ni grouped by Rel.To.Brook\n")
numSummary(hubbard$EXCH_Ni, groups=hubbard$Rel.To.Brook)
```

For `numSummary()` tables, try the following:

- generating summary tables for more than one variable at a time
- generating summary tables with fewer statistical parameters (*e.g*. omit IQR) or more statistical parameters (*e.g*. include skewness)<br>
(use R Studio Help!)
- try copying the output to Word or Excel and using this to make a table in that software<br>...and so on.

### Tables using `print()` on a data frame

Data frames are themselves tables, and if they already contain the type of summary we need, we can just use the  `print()` function to get output. Let's do something [slightly] fancy (see if you can figure out what is going on here&#185;):

```{r table-print, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, results='hold'}
output <- 
  numSummary(hubbard[,c("PH","MOISTURE.pct","OM.pct","Al.pct","Ca.pct","Fe.pct")],
             statistics = c("mean","sd","quantiles"), quantiles=c(0,0.5,1))
mytable <- t(cbind(output$table,output$NAs))
row.names(mytable) <- c("Mean","Std.dev.","Min.","Median","Max.","Missing")
# here's where we get the output
print(mytable, digits=3)
write.table(mytable,"clipboard",sep="\t")
cat("\nThe table has now been copied to the clipboard, so you can paste it into Excel!\n")
```

If you want to take this further, we can start making really nice Tables for
reports with various **R** packages. I use the `flextable` package and sometimes
the `kable()` function from the `knitr` package.

&#185;Hints: we have made two data frame objects, one from the output of
`numSummary()`; `t()` is the transpose function; there are also some other
useful functions which might be new to you like: `row.names()`, `cbind()`,
`print()`, `write.table()` . . .

If you want to take this further, we can start making really nice Tables for
reports with various **R** packages. I use the `flextable` package (Gohel &
Skintzos, 2022) and sometimes the `kable()` function from the `knitr` package.
Here's an example (Table 1) using `flextable` and the
table object `mytable` made above:

```{r flextable-demo, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(flextable)
flextable(data.frame(Statistic=row.names(mytable),signif(mytable,3))) |>
  bold(bold=TRUE, part="header") |>
  set_caption(caption="Table 1: Table created by the `flextable` R package. Many more table formatting, text formatting, and number formatting options are available in this package.")
```
