# What is R?

**R** is called a "**statistical computing environment**". This means two things:

1.  **R** is software that allows us to perform statistical analysis of data;
2.  **R** is a type of computer programming code (a language).

In **R** these two features are combined so that we perform the tasks we need to by writing instructions in **R** code. We commonly want to:

-   create or input data
-   format, store, and save our data
-   perform statistical and numerical analysis of our data
-   display our data and report our analysis in graphs and tables

By using **R** code to do this, we can easily *reproduce* our analyses, that is, use *exactly* the same procedures again on additional data, or simply re-create what we have done. We can save our **R** code in simple 'text' files, or even in a document called an **R Notebook** which uses a few additional coding features (called 'R markdown') to let us save our code and the results of our analysis in the same document. We use R markdown to produce documents such as reports (this document is created using R markdown).

<hr style="height: 2px; background-color: #660F00;" />

## R and RStudio

To make our job of using **R** easier, we'll be using the **RStudio** program. RStudio is an IDE or 'integrated development environment' which puts everything we need for R coding in one place, and has some helpful tools (such as predictive text for code, and some menu-driven functions) to make coding easier. In this document, when we say '**R**', we really mean 'R in the RStudio environment'.

```{r fig-RStudio, fig.height=5.4, fig.width=7.2, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 1: The RStudio window with a very brief explanation of some different sub-panes.", warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hold', echo=FALSE}
fig1 <- readPNG("./docs/images/RStudio.png")
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(c(0,1),c(0,1), axes=F, type="n",xaxt="n", yaxt="n",ann=F)
addImg(fig1, x = 0.5, y = 0.5, width = 1)
```

## Three things we really need to know about using **R**

1.  **How data are stored**. **R** can handle many different types of data, such as numbers, text, categories, spatial coordinates, images, and so on. **R** uses various types of *objects* to store different types of data in different ways.

2.  **Code-based instructions**. If we want **R** to do something for us, we need to give it instructions. We do this in other software too, commonly by using a mouse or other pointing device to click and select options from a menu. For example, in **R** we can sort a table of data by writing the instructions in **R** code:

```{r compare Excel sorting, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
data_sorted <- data[order(data$column1, data$column2),] 
```

You don't have to remember this (yet). The code here is also to illustrate that, in this document, **R** code will be shown in blocks like the one above having a `shaded background and fixed-space font`.

In Excel, we can do the same thing, but we would use a sequence of point-and-click operations, such as that shown below:

(a) using the mouse to select the cells we want to sort;
(b) clicking on the Data menu;
(c) clicking on the Sort button;
(d) choosing the column we want to sort by in the dialog box that appears;
(e) clicking 'OK'.

3.  (We did say three things.) **R** is **very** literal, and needs precise instructions to do everything. A small error in our code will mean we get wrong, or no, results. For example, all **R** code is case-sensitive. Also, if we don't tell R where to look for things, it won't try anywhere else just in case we might have intended another location!<br />[Go here for a great page on common errors in **R** and how to fix them](https://statsandr.com/blog/top-10-errors-in-r/){target="_blank"}

## Types of data we commonly use in **R**

### Single numbers

**R** can work with single numbers, much like a complex calculator.

To "run" **R** code, we can type it into the RStudio Console and press the 
`enter` key. We will see the results of running the code also in the Console, 
below the code we just entered.

```{r as a calculator 1}
123 + 456
```

```{r as a calculator 2}
sqrt(731)
```

```{r fig-1, fig.height=2.41, fig.width=6.16, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 2: Understanding simple R functions and output.", warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hold', echo=FALSE}
fig1 <- readPNG("./docs/images/function_results.png")
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(c(0,1),c(0,1), axes=F, type="n",xaxt="n", yaxt="n",ann=F)
addImg(fig1, x = 0.5, y = 0.5, width = 1)
```

We don't usually use R like this, but it's handy to know that we have a calculator handy if we need in in the **R** Console!

<table border=2 width="100%" cellpadding="5" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-color: #3F57B8;">
<tr><td>**R functions**

This is also the place to introduce Functions in **R**. We just used a function -- to calculate a square root: `sqrt(731)`.

An R function is identified by a **name** such as `sqrt`, `t.test` or `plot`, followed by **arguments** in parentheses `( )` (the parentheses can be empty, for example `help.start()` -- try it!). We used the argument `731` in the `sqrt()` function -- some functions require several arguments, as you will see. Some arguments have default 'built-in' values.

There are huge numbers of built-in functions in **R** which we can use after first installing **R**, "straight out of the box" (we call this "**base R**"). For instance, see the [R reference card v2 by Matt Baggott](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf){target="_blank"}.

If we can't find the functions we need, they may be available in **R packages** which are additional libraries of functions that we can install from within the **R** environment. A commonly used package is `car`, the <u>c</u>ompanion to <u>a</u>pplied <u>r</u>egression. We would install this into **R** using a function `install.packages("car")`, which stores the library on our device. To use the functions in the `car` package we would load the library into our **R** session by running `library(car)`.

We can also write our own functions in **R** and we may show you examples of these as you progress through this course.</td></tr>

### Vectors

A vector is a one-dimensional set of numbers, similar to a column or row of values in a spreadsheet. We use the simple function `c()` to **c**ombine, or put together, a set of values. The code below shows how we can make a vector **object** using the assign code `<-` to give our vector a name of our choice. Just by entering the vector object's name, we can then see its contents:

```{r make and view a vector}
a <- c(1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10)
a
```

We can also check the type of object using the `class()` function, or using another function that asks if the object is in a specific class (*e.g*. `is.vector()` or `is.character()`).

```{r}
class(a)
is.vector(a)
is.character(a)
```

We can also make use of the square brackets: remember from Figure 2 that the values in square brackets `[ ]` are the index for a set of values. For a vector, which is one dimensional, we just need one value in `[ ]` at the end of our object name to select particular values:

```{r}
a[3]
# we can also use a range of values
a[7:10]
```

There are some other useful ways to make vectors in **R**, such as the functions `seq()` (**seq**uence) and `rep()` (**rep**eat) (and many others!). Try changing some of the code below and running it, to make sure you understand the results each time.

```{r vector with sequence}
# make a vector with a sequence of numbers from 2 to 80 in steps of 2
b <- seq(2,80,2)
b
```

Notice that if we have a long vector, the number in square brackets at the beginning of each line tells us which item the line starts with.

```{r vector by repeating}
# make a vector of the number 12 repeated 20 times
d <- rep(12,20)
d
```

### Matrices

A matrix is a two-dimensional set of data with rows and columns. All of the entries must be the same type (*e.g*. integer, numeric, character). We can make a matrix using a vector (*e.g*. `b` from above), so long as we specify how many rows and/or columns we want:

```{r matrix from vector}
m <- matrix(b, nrow = 5)
m
```

By default we fill each column in order, but we can change this by using the [byrow = ]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color:#e8e8e8;"}[TRUE]{style="font-family: monospace; color:#600080; background-color:#e8e8e8;"} option.

```{r matrix from vector byrow}
m <- matrix(b, ncol = 8, byrow = TRUE)
m
```

We can locate each value in the matrix using a two-part index in square brackets `[row, column]`. Here are some examples (note that we *always* need the comma):

```{r select value in matrix with index}
# single value at [row,column]
selection <- m[2,3] 
selection
```

```{r select row using index}
# a whole row by itself
selection <- m[4,]
selection
```

```{r select column using index}
# a whole column by itself
selection <- m[,8]
selection
```

### Data frames

Data frames are one of the most common ways to store data in **R**. They are two-dimensional like matrices, with rows and columns, but the columns can contain different types of data such as numbers (integer or numeric), text (character), or categories (factor), *etc*..

Data frame are one of the best ways to store "real" data which can contain information such as sample IDs, treatments, replicates, coordinates, categories, measurements, dates/times, *etc*. Let's make one and look at its properties.

```{r make data frame from scratch, paged.print=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(Name = c("Sample 1","Sample 2","Sample 3","Sample 4","Sample 5"),
                 Group = as.factor(c("New","New","Old","Old","Old")),
                 Value = c(2.34,4.56,3.45,5.67,6.54),
                 Count = as.integer(c(21,35,19,18,27)))
df
```

We can see that we made a data frame '`df`' with 4 columns and 5 rows (the first column of output is the row number, not part of the data frame's column count). All the columns contain a different type of information which we can see using the `str()` (**str**ucture) function:

```{r str function}
str(df)
```

The output of str() shows that the column called `Name` contains `chr` (character = text) information, `Group` is a `Factor` *(i.e*. categorical information) with two `levels` or categories, `Value` is `num` (numeric = real numbers), and `Count` is `int` (integer).

**Data frames** are a very common way of storing our data in the **R**
environment. The rows of our data frame represent our **observations** or
'samples'. The columns of a data frame  are the **variables** -- information
about the samples which may be identifying information (character or categorical
information), or measurements (usually numeric information such as counts or
concentrations).

We should notice that each column name is preceded by a dollar sign `$`, and we also use this to specify single columns from a data frame:

```{r dollar for columns}
# both lines of code below should give the same output!
df$Value
df[,3]
```

### Other types of object in R

There are *many* other object types in **R**! Many of these are specialised to
handle specific types of data, such as time series, spatial data, or raster
images. One of the more common **R** objects is the **list**, which is a 
collection of different object types -- often if we save the output of a 
function, it will be as an object of class `list`.

## Working with files

### Telling RStudio where to find our files

We've just seen how we can create data in R by typing it in, and some of our examples in class will do this, but the most common way of getting our data into **R** is to **read (input) from a file**.

Before we read any files, though, we need to tell **R** where to find the files we've saved, downloaded, or created. There are 2 ways to do this in RStudio:

1.  In the top level menu, click Session » Set Working Directory » Choose Directory. This will open a window showing just folders (= *directories*). Click on the folder where your files are, and click the [&nbsp;Open&nbsp;]{style="background-color:#808080; color:white;"} button.

2.  With the RStudio [&nbsp;Files&nbsp;]{style="background-color:#808080; color:white"} pane already showing the files you are working with, click [&nbsp;More&nbsp;]{style="background-color:#808080; color:white;"}, then [&nbsp;Set As Working Directory&nbsp;]{style="background-color:#808080; color:white;"}.

### Opening (and saving) a code file

If we write some code that works, it's good to save it so we can use it again or
adapt it for a similar task. In classes, we will provide you with code files 
(having the extension `.R`) to help you learn what **R** code does.

To open a code file we have a few options:

1. just type `ctrl-O`, and choose the file from the 'Open file' window that appears
2. click on the open file ![](./images/openfile32.png){width=24 height=24} icon, and choose the file from the 'Open file' window that appears
3. click on the file shown in the `Files` pane (lower right, see Figures 1 and 3) in the RStudio screen.

You can type code into a new file made by the keystroke combination 
`ctrl-shift-N` (for other new file types, use the RStudio menu `File/New file`).

Files can be saved by typing `ctrl-S` (you will be prompted for a new file name 
the first time you save a new file), or clicking the file-save ![](./images/save-file-disk-32.png){width=24 height=24} icon.

### Opening a data file

In classes, we will mainly supply data as CSV ([C]{.underline}omma [S]{.underline}eparated [V]{.underline}alue, or .csv) files. These are a simple and widely-used way to store tabular data such as found in an **R** data frame, and can also be opened in Excel and other software.

**R** has a specific function for reading .csv files, `read.csv()`. If we know that our file contains categorical information present as text, we should also include the option [stringsAsFactors = ]{style="font-family: monospace; background-color:#e8e8e8;"}[TRUE]{style="font-family: monospace; color:#6000A0; background-color:#e8e8e8;"} (we can shorten [TRUE]{style="font-family: monospace; color:#6000A0; background-color:#e8e8e8;"} to [T]{style="font-family: monospace; color:#6000A0; background-color:#e8e8e8;"}).

```{r dataframe from file, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
df <- read.csv(file = "df.csv", stringsAsFactors = T)
df
```

If the file is not in our Working Directory, we would need to specify the whole path. We can also read directly from an internet address:

```{r read csv full path or url, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
df <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/neo/LocalData/R Projects/Learning R/df.csv",
               stringsAsFactors = T)
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ratey-AtUWA/learningR/main/df.csv",
               stringsAsFactors = T)
```

You might notice that we didn't include `file = ` in the second example above. We can do this because `file = ` is the option **R** expects first in the `read.csv()` function.

### Saving and running code in files

In **R** we usually run code from a file rather than typing lines of code into
the **R** Console. **R** code files that we provide for you to use will usually 
have the extension `.R`. We can:

- **Open** files by clicking File/Open File... (or typing `ctrl-O` on the keyboard), then choosing from our computer or network file system
- **Create** new `.R` code files by clicking File/New File/R Script (or typing `ctrl-shift-N` on the keyboard), then typing in code. *Don't forget to save the file!*

```{r fig-RStudio-file, fig.height=4, fig.width=7.2, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Figure 3: The RStudio window showing the `Source` sub-pane (and the other panes).", warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hold', echo=FALSE}
fig1 <- readPNG("./docs/images/RStudio2.png")
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(c(0,1),c(0,1), axes=F, type="n",xaxt="n", yaxt="n",ann=F)
addImg(fig1, x = 0.5, y = 0.5, width = 1.0)
```

In an open **R** code file, we can **run** lines or chunks of code by selecting
the code to be run with our pointing device, then clicking the <span
style="background-color:#808080; color:white">&#9646;<span
style="color:#80FF00;">&#10152;</span><span
style="color:white;">Run&nbsp;</span></span> button at the top of the
source pane, or typing `ctrl-enter`.<br />
We can actually just put our cursor anywhere in a line of code and click 
<span style="background-color:#808080; color:white">&#9646;<span style="color:#80FF00;">&#10152;</span><span style="color:white;">Run&nbsp;</span></span> or type `ctrl-enter`.

<hr style="height: 1px; background-color: #5560A4;" />

<p style="text-align:center">![](./images/helpStress.png)</p>

## Built-in R Help

How do we find out the order of options in a function? Well, **R** and RStudio have excellent **Help** utilities. For example, if we run the code `help("read.csv")` or just `?read.csv` in the RStudio Console (usually the bottom-left pane), this will open the relevant help page in the Help pane at (lower) right. We can also search directly in the help pane.

If we're unsure about anything in R, especially, we may be able to find it in the Help system. A very useful place to start is by running the code below to get to the general help page:

```{r help start page, eval=FALSE}
help.start()
```

Hopefully we don't need to manually open the <http://127.0.0.1:30394/doc/html/index.html> link; either way we will see a page like that below in our RStudio help pane, or in our web browser.
